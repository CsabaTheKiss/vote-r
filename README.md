# Vote-R

A basic voting app, wrote in Angular 2 and Typescript.

It's meant to help in organizing team building events: add your name, vote on event, see the results!

## Inital release

Please note, that the current release is a really basic version.
The server side is mocked out, serious refactoring is needed.

## How to install, and run

Please note, that this version runs only locally, no server side is implemented just yet.

```
npm install
npm start
```
